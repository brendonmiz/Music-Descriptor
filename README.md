# Music-Descriptor

This project is an experiment featuring 30 novel string quarted excerpts, all composed by me in Finale, rated in four separate surveys (two each in English and French) by both French and American listeners. The first survey asked participants who had minimum 10 years of formal music training to rate the excerpts on various musical dimensions or qualities, such as harmony, tempo, genre, etc. The second asked participants to assign adjectives to the excerpts. The second survey did not have a musical training requirement. 
The data were analyzed using multivariate techniques, including correspondence analysis, distance analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, and partial least squares correlation. Check out the HTML files for the finished output, or the RMD for each analysis for all the nitty-gritty detail.
